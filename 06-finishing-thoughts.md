## Part 6. Finishing Thoughts

With that, our tutorial is over! You've achieved many of the core steps necessary to building software robots, that is:
1. You've created a fully functioning software robot that retrieves an image for you and displays it.
2. You've been introduced to the concepts of [**Cells**](./01-cells.robot), [`*** Settings ***`](./01-cells.robot), [`*** Tasks ***`](./02-tasks.robot) and [`*** Keywords ***`](./03-keywords.robot)
3. You've even [published your robot to the Cloud](./05-moving-our-robot-to-the-cloud.robot) where it has even more powerful capabilities, such as saving our robot's chosen image as a new file

Despite all that you've learned you may still have questions, such as:
- What's the fourth cell type for building robots?
- Can I only ever select the first image from Google Images?
- Where can I see other utilities available to my robots?
- Where can I see other example robots?
- Where can I learn other Robocorp Lab shortcuts like running the all the robot's cells in one button click with `▸▸`?

It's great that you have so many more questions and answers to all these and more can be found in our [online documentation](https://robocorp.com/docs/). We suggest you go there to explore more.

Please return to Robocorp Cloud to join our software-robot-developers' Slack for tips and tricks, leave questions and suggestions on our forum and, finally, wield your ability to create robotic armies for good!

When you feel ready, close Robocorp Lab, reopen it and on the Welcome screen explore other example robots Robocorp has created; or, start your own from scratch! If you get stuck, a `Get Help` button can be found on that screen too.
