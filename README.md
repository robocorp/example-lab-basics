# Robocorp Lab's Interactive Tutorial

Over the course of this simple 6-part tutorial, using the power of Robot Framework, you'll create a working software robot that:
* opens a web browser
* searches for an image of our choosing
* display the image to you

You'll then move your new software robot to live in the Robocorp Cloud, where the image will be saved as a new file for later use.

### This tutorial will take `~25 minutes` and consists of:
1. [Understanding Cells](./01-cells.robot)
2. [Tasks](./02-tasks.robot)
3. [Keywords](./03-keywords.robot)
4. [Running Our Robot](./04-running-our-robot.robot)
5. [Moving Our Robot to the Cloud](./05-moving-our-robot-to-the-cloud.robot)
6. [Finishing Thoughts](./06-finishing-thoughts.md)

As you proceed through each part you'll be introduced to the basic ideas and features related to software robot development and suggestions for further learning.
